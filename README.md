#How to make custom pcbs for Fritzing using Inkscape. 
---

##### Needing to make a fairly simple 2 sided pcbs that was not a standard square or circle variant used in Fritzing I found any info very lacking on the web. Here I hope to show you how to accomplish that fairly painlessly. There are few examples on how to do plus they're old and vague. I hope for the average user this guide will attempt to make it as painless as possible to show the basics of desgning a custom pcb. I will be using Inkscape on a Mac but it should very similar on other os's.
